## HOMEWORK

### Due today

    - In a short paragraph, what is the purpose of your final map?

    - What data will you need and where are some places you might look for it?

    - What layers will you need in addition to the base map?

    - What kind of interactions will you afford the users?

    - Will you need any features not covered in class so far?

- Extra: if you plan to have features other than the map (buttons, data visualizations etc), it may be helpful to draw a wireframe

### Due Next Week:
- A functional base map
- Either a drawn mockup/wireframe of the map or a map with the main components in place. ie. It’s ok if menus are there but selecting options don’t work
